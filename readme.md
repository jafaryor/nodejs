## NodeJS Homeworks
* `input-reverser` - Write a program which reads a string from the standard input `stdin` in stand-by mode, reverses it and then writes it to the standard output stdout.
* `cs-to-json-converter` - Write a program which should do the following:
    * Read the content of csvfile from./csvdirectory.
    * Use the [csvtojsonpackage](https://github.com/Keyang/node-csvtojson) to convert csvfile to jsonobject.
    * Write the csvfile content to a new txtfile.
    * Do not load all the content of the csvfile into RAM via stream (read/write file content line by line).
    * In case of read/write errors, log them in the console.
* `cs-to-json-converter` - Rewrite the `homework-02` using the [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and `ES6` modules.
